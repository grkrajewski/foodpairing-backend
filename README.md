Foodpairing application is the REST API. It was created all by my own during Kodilla Bootcamp - Java Developer Plus.
It is the final, individual project, which summarize Kodilla Bootcamp. The final project wes realized without mentor support.

Application includes:
- SOLID, DRY, YAGNI principles,
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE http methods,
- two external APIs were integrated ("Spoonacular", "TheCocktailDB"),
- two design patterns (builder, facade),
- unit tests with coverage 79%,
- MySQL database used as a storage system,
- scheduler (sending an e-mail information),
- frontend layer performed with Vaadin framework (link below).

Main technologies, which were used:
Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Spring WEB, JUnit5, Mockito, MySQL, Vaadin.

All endpoints were tested either with using Postman and with the help of frontend layer, which was made with the usage of Vaadin.
Frontend part was created only to show the functionality and to support backend testing.

Short description of project functionality:
- you search dish by key word from first external API and save it in local database,
- you create composition with chosen dish and random drink from second external API,
- if the drink is unacceptable, you can change it to the next random drink,
- after you create your composition, you can update the drink in composition and change its ingredients,
- you can comment compositions and also give feedback to the comments.
In the future I will develop the API, adding new functionalities to it.

Backend project link: https://github.com/grkrajewski/foodpairing-backend - port: 8080
Frontend project link: https://github.com/grkrajewski/foodpairing-frontend - port: 8081

Either backend and fronted application should be downloaded and run locally. The project is based on local MySQL database.
After running projects, run your web browser and go to the page:
